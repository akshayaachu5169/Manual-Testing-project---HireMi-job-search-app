# Manual Testing project-HireMi job search app
HireMi is a job search app designed to help job seekers find employment opportunities quickly and effortlessly.
During my one-month internship at Wyreflow Technologies, I built strong manual testing skills by thoroughly testing applications and writing detailed test cases for each feature.
I led the timely completion of daily tasks, meeting deadlines effectively and ensuring high-quality submissions. 
I drove productive discussions during review meetings to address application issues and suggest improvements.
This experience taught me the importance of collaboration, attention to detail, and adhering to deadlines in a professional setting
